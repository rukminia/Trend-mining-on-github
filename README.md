1. Introduction and Purpose of Experiment
   
GitHub, being a prominent platform for collaborative software development, hosts a vast network of developers and repositories. This experiment focuses on trend mining within the GitHub community, aiming to unravel insights into the relationships between users and repositories. The primary goal is to identify and visualize patterns of interest, examining how developers interact with repositories and the programming languages associated with their projects.
The experiment utilizes data extraction and analysis techniques, integrating GitHub's API with Python programming. By constructing a social graph of users and repositories, the experiment explores the dynamics of interactions, such as users starring repositories and their programming language preferences.
Two distinct approaches are employed for visualization. The first leverages D3.js to create an interactive and dynamic web-based visualization, providing a comprehensive overview of the GitHub social network. The second approach employs Matplotlib to generate a static graph within the Jupyter Notebook environment, offering a more straightforward representation of the network.
This experiment is positioned within the broader context of trend mining on GitHub, with the visualization serving as a valuable tool for researchers and developers to explore and comprehend the evolving landscape of collaborative coding practices.

2.Aim:
The aim of this experiment is to perform trend mining on GitHub, extracting valuable insights from the collaborative coding platform's extensive dataset.
